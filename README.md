# Dynasty Game written in Ruby

A dynasty ruling game written in Ruby for use in a command line interface. Build and grow your own dynasty. Grow and conquer at will! Yet how long will your dynasty survive? Play to find out!

## Background

This game was written as a simple example and demonstration of a computer game that can replicate historical phenomena. It simulates the rise and fall of a dynasty. The progression of the dynasty and the timing of its end depend on decisions made by the user. Strategies can be used to prolong the lifetime of the dynasty.

## Getting Started

1. Download this file. 

2. Then run the program using Ruby on your command line, such as:

`ruby DynastyGame.rb`

3. Then follow the displayed instructions.

## Troubleshooting

- If you can't run it, you might not have a current version of Ruby installed. Ruby is a programming language. You don't need to know it to play the game, but you do need to have it installed.
- If your dynasty is ending too quickly, be less belligerent. 

## Licence
